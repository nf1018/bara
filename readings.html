    In an interview with Barnes and Nobles, Gengoroh Tagame talks about one of his latest projects -- <i>My Brother's Husband and Me</i>. The manga is a warm family story about Yaichi, a single father faced with a new set of realities when Mike, the husband of his late twin brother Ryoji, comes for a visit. It’s not sexually explicit, but it is emotionally explicit, as Mike deals with his loss and Yaichi tries to come to terms with his brother’s sexuality. Yaichi’s young daughter Kana is the intermediary, jumping into awkward situations and defusing them with a child’s disarming frankness. The manga is being published in two omnibus volumes in the U.S.
