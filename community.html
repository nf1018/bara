      “As is clear from the life histories collected by Yajima (1997) and myself [...] one of the most important functions of the gay magazines is to help gay men network in the wider gay community.”

      "The motivation behind writing My Brother’s Husband has been the same as the motivation behind all my writing, which is I write what I want to read. What I want to see in the world isn’t out there, so I create it. So in that sense I don’t think of it as very different in terms of what motivates me to write it, the content notwithstanding."

      "Way back when I was a high school student in the early 2000s, stumbling across images of gay manga online was a watershed moment for my budding queer identity. It felt like a wall had been broken down between the concept of gay culture I was used to — the limited representations of homosexuality presented by American mass media — and the wide world of possibilities implied by these images coming out of Japan. Whether it was a mischievous smile on Jiraiya’s hulking pin-ups or a tender picture of robust, big-bellied men cuddling in Seizoh Ebisubashi’s manga, these artists were picturing unique visions of gay desire that resonated deeply with me."

    Bara manga represents the only male-male erotic culture to focus solely on the butch masculine body rather than the younger submissive bishōnen (“pretty boy”) character. Bara art, comics, and literature emerged in the post-World War II period as a genre of media made primarily by and for masculine gay men as an alternative to the more feminized/transgender images of homosexuality popular in the commercial entertainment world. Many of the original gay artists of the 1950s and 60s produced both exhibited and comic materials during their career, while younger artists maintain the close relationship between gay art and gay comics. Bara manga still to this day makes up only a small portion of bara media, but greater marketability and increasing interest in gay comics, in part aided by Internet communication, has bolstered the number of bara manga titles in recent decades, making it a significant space for exploring Japanese gay identities.
