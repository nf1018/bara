    Gengoroh Tagame: The motivation behind writing My Brother’s Husband has been the same as the motivation behind all my writing, which is I write what I want to read. What I want to see in the world isn’t out there, so I create it. So in that sense I don’t think of it as very different in terms of what motivates me to write it, the content notwithstanding.

    Graham Kolbeins: Way back when I was a high school student in the early 2000s, stumbling across images of gay manga online was a watershed moment for my budding queer identity. It felt like a wall had been broken down between the concept of gay culture I was used to — the limited representations of homosexuality presented by American mass media — and the wide world of possibilities implied by these images coming out of Japan. Whether it was a mischievous smile on Jiraiya’s hulking pin-ups or a tender picture of robust, big-bellied men cuddling in Seizoh Ebisubashi’s manga, these artists were picturing unique visions of gay desire that resonated deeply with me.
