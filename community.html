      <font size="+2">“As is clear from the life histories collected by Yajima (1997) and myself [...] one of the most important functions of the gay magazines is to help gay men network in the wider gay community.”

      "The motivation behind writing My Brother’s Husband has been the same as the motivation behind all my writing, which is I write what I want to read. What I want to see in the world isn’t out there, so I create it. So in that sense I don’t think of it as very different in terms of what motivates me to write it, the content notwithstanding."

      "Way back when I was a high school student in the early 2000s, stumbling across images of gay manga online was a watershed moment for my budding queer identity. It felt like a wall had been broken down between the concept of gay culture I was used to — the limited representations of homosexuality presented by American mass media — and the wide world of possibilities implied by these images coming out of Japan. Whether it was a mischievous smile on Jiraiya’s hulking pin-ups or a tender picture of robust, big-bellied men cuddling in Seizoh Ebisubashi’s manga, these artists were picturing unique visions of gay desire that resonated deeply with me."
