      “As is clear from the life histories collected by Yajima (1997) and myself [...] one of the most important functions of the gay magazines is to help gay men network in the wider gay community.”

      "The motivation behind writing My Brother’s Husband has been the same as the motivation behind all my writing, which is I write what I want to read. What I want to see in the world isn’t out there, so I create it. So in that sense I don’t think of it as very different in terms of what motivates me to write it, the content notwithstanding."

      "Way back when I was a high school student in the early 2000s, stumbling across images of gay manga online was a watershed moment for my budding queer identity. It felt like a wall had been broken down between the concept of gay culture I was used to — the limited representations of homosexuality presented by American mass media — and the wide world of possibilities implied by these images coming out of Japan. Whether it was a mischievous smile on Jiraiya’s hulking pin-ups or a tender picture of robust, big-bellied men cuddling in Seizoh Ebisubashi’s manga, these artists were picturing unique visions of gay desire that resonated deeply with me."

    In regards to the medium of print, <i>Bara</i> makes up an insignificant amount of the male-male erotic manga genre. The popular male-male erotic manga characters are typically femme, young, submissive, and sometimes even resembling transgender individuals— known as a <i>bishōnen</i> (“pretty boy”) character. All genres of <i>Bara</i> emerged in the postwar era as a genre made by masculine gay men, for masculine gay men. Although the space in the world of comics is insignificant, the space for exploring Japanese identity, especially with its increase in access because of the internet, is. In an interview with the <i>Huffington Post</i>, Graham Kolbeins claims, “…[<i>para</i>] manga also owes a lot of Japan’s home-grown history of male-male sexual culture.”

Unlike other forms of <i>bara</i> art, manga sticks to its cultural routes. The appropriation seen in other genres of <i>bara</i> is hyper visible on the internet: When searched in google, the images that are shown are not necessarily Japanese — or traditionally considered <i>bara</i> — and with qualifiers in the search, like “anime,” “gif,” or “transparent,” these searches stray further from the definition of the word, often encompassing non-human, non-masculine men. In the gaming world, <i>bara</i> has a slight present in the dating sims world and various <a href="https://itch.io/c/176560/bara-gamesl">noncommercial flash games</a>; however, many of these games, like <i>Super Health Club</i> are far removed from Japanese culture and feature a set predominately white characters interacting with one or two Japanese ones. This shift is not necessarily bad — the genre is still being used as a means of exploring identity —, but  it often sets up stereotypical tropes (albeit racial) that the genre tried to remove itself from when it became a response to <i>Yaoi</i>. Like all cultures, new isn’t necessarily bad — but it is important to not forget its roots.
