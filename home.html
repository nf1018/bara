    <h2>BARA</h2>

    <p>Bara (薔薇, "rose"), also known by the wasei-eigo construction "Men's Love" (ML メンズラブ, "menzu rabu"), is a Japanese technical term for a genre of art and fictional media that focuses on male same-sex love usually created by gay men for a gay audience. This genre of manga began in the 1950’s as a fetish magazine — ADONIS (1952) — featuring gay art and content, but the popularity did not arise until the 1970’s magazine, self-titled after the genre, Barazoku (薔薇族) — “the rose tribe.” </p>

        One of the reasons Bara popularized in the 70’s was due to an internal need for the genre in the gay male community. In the 60’s and 70’s Yaoi (/ˈjaʊi/; Japanese: やおい), primarily known as boys' love (BL) (ボーイズ ラブ bōizu rabu), a genre of fictional media focusing on romantic or sexual relationships between male characters, typically was marketed only for a female audience and was usually created by female authors. The genre is about belonging; much like sequential art has historically in Japan — whether via Kamishibai during WWII to help foster a united front or emphasizing how nuclear power is friendly in Astro Boy — Bara is a form of kyōdōtai, a sense of community through shared experience.

       Albeit his work did not start till the 80’s, Gengoroh Tagame has been called the most influential creator of gay manga in Japan to date, and "the most talented and most famous author of sado-masochistic gay manga". Most of his work first appeared in gay magazines and usually feature sexual abuse. Tagame's depiction of men as muscular and hairy has been cited as a catalyst for a shift in fashion amongst gay men in 1995, away from the clean-shaven and slender bishōnen stereotypes and towards a tendency for masculinity and chubbiness. Tagame's work has been criticised by notable gay manga writer Susumu Hirosegawa as "SM gekijō" (S&M theater) for its violence and lack of complex storylines.

        In Japan, this sense of community in queer places is important, because of the lack of rights LGBTQ+ individuals have in Japan. Albeit the country is modernizing and becoming more accepting, there are no rights to protect individuals from discrimination. This attitude stems from the traditional belief of the “ie system,” an infrastructure that emphasizes carrying on traditions of the family name; if you’re LGBTQ+ and seek to start a family, this jeopardizes generations of traditions.
